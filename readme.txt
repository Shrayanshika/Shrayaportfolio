DESCRIPTION:
Hi I'm Shrayanshika. Welcome to my learning space! 
This is where I explore, document, and share ideas, concepts, and product lessons.
I'm discovering along the way. Everything you’ll find here is shaped by curiosity, 
hands-on experience, and my point of view as a product manager navigating tech, data, 
and design. Think of it as my digital notebook—open to the world. 

To build this portfolio I have used open source HTML design template called "LUTHER" by styleshout.com. 
Hence this portolio is not for redistribution, I'm using it for personal use of showcasing the work I have done.

SUPPORT:
    
Since LUTHER is distributed for free, support is not offered. LUTHER is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - https://marksheet.io/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
javascript in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:
